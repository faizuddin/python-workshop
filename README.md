# Python Workshop

Materials and notebooks used in Python workshops.

1. Introduction to Data Analysis
    1. Begin by executing the `eda.ipynb` notebook to import the data and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) prior to cleaning the raw dataset. Upon execution of this notebook, the raw dataset will be exported as `clean-dataset.csv`.
    2. Next, in the `model.ipynb` notebook, load the clean dataset. Perform data normalisation, train the models, and compare them accordingly.
